# Changelog

## 7.1.1

* Fix: `rake sitemap:clean` (`clean_files`) now respects the configured `sitemaps_path`/`public_path` and also removes uncompressed `.xml` sitemaps, instead of only deleting hardcoded `public/sitemap*.xml.gz` files. [#474](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/474) [#502](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/502)
* Fix: `SitemapGenerator::Interpreter` now respects `ActionController::Base.default_url_options`, so Rails URL helpers honor globally configured defaults (e.g. `:protocol`, `:port`) instead of ignoring them. [#355](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/355) [#507](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/507)
* Fix: Non-ASCII characters in URL paths are now percent-encoded in the `<loc>` element, so generated sitemaps conform to the sitemap protocol. [#346](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/346) [#506](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/506)
* Fix: Relative alternate hreflang hrefs (starting with `/`) are now expanded to absolute URLs using the configured host, producing valid sitemap XML instead of broken relative links. [#343](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/343) [#504](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/504)
* Fix: `SitemapGenerator.verbose = false` is now respected by `rake sitemap:refresh` and other rake tasks, silencing output as configured. [#332](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/332) [#503](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/503)
* Fix: Sitemap file `lastmod` is now captured at write time rather than read back via `File.mtime`, fixing incorrect timestamps and improving compatibility with time-freezing test helpers. [#508](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/508)
* Fix: URL `lastmod` now defaults to `Time.zone.now` under Rails (falling back to `Time.now` otherwise), so the configured Rails timezone and time-freezing helpers like `travel_to` are respected instead of always using system local time. [#422](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/422) [#505](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/505)
* Internal: Enable RuboCop on the spec suite (previously fully excluded), fix real bugs the linting surfaced along the way (always-passing tests with no assertions, a latent `NameError`, broken path comparisons), and resolve all temporary RuboCop spec-suite exclusions. [#510](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/510) [#511](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/511) [#512](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/512) [#513](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/513) [#514](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/514)

## 7.1.0

* **Breaking:** `SitemapGenerator::FileAdapter#plain` has been removed. It was an internal helper inlined into `#write` to fix a file descriptor leak; any code calling it directly should call `#write` instead. [#492](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/492)
* **Breaking:** `SitemapGenerator::FileAdapter#gzip` is now private. It was always an implementation detail; external callers should not need to invoke it directly. [#492](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/492)
* Fix: `AwsSdkAdapter` and `S3Adapter` now derive the `Content-Type` header from the file extension (`.xml` → `application/xml`, `.xml.gz` → `application/x-gzip`) via the new `SitemapLocation#content_type` helper, rather than always sending `application/x-gzip`. [#329](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/329) [#338](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/338) [#495](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/495)
* Docs: Replace broken links in README and CHANGES.md; add deprecation notices for mobile sitemaps (deprecated by Google in August 2022) and geo sitemaps (retired by Google in February 2012). [#497](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/497)
* Internal: enforce RuboCop across all source files, resolve all pre-existing offenses, add RuboCop and mdl (Markdown) linting to GitHub Actions CI, and add pre-commit git hooks that lint staged Ruby and Markdown files locally. [#487](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/487) [#492](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/492) [#493](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/493) [#494](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/494) [#500](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/500)

## 7.0.3

* **Regression fix:** Revert railtie enhancements (#478) that were unintentionally included in 7.0.2. Those changes introduced an `ArgumentError: Missing host to link to!` during `assets:precompile` and other Rails boot contexts where no host is configured (reported in [#488](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/issues/488)). The railtie is restored to its 7.0.1 behaviour: it loads rake tasks only. The enhancements will return in a future release with proper documentation and test coverage. [#489](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/489)
* **Bugfix:** Restore sitemap generation on Ruby 2.x when `--enable=frozen-string-literal` is set globally. Ruby 2.6/2.7 freezes interpolated heredocs under that flag, causing `gsub!` to raise `FrozenError`. [#486](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/486)
* Internal: skip duplicate git tag creation in the release task if the tag already points at HEAD.

## 7.0.2

* Reduce string copies and improve compatibility with `frozen_string_literal`. [#456](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/456)

## 7.0.1

* **Breaking:** Default search engines list is empty. `rake sitemap:refresh` and `ping_search_engines` perform no HTTP pings unless you configure engine URLs on `search_engines` or pass them into `ping_search_engines` (Google’s ping endpoint is deprecated upstream). [#444](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/444)
* **Breaking:** `LinkSet#create` runs `finalize!` only when a block is given. Calling `create` without a block requires `finalize!` when you are done adding links (supported workflow for programmatic builds). [#463](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/463)
* **Breaking:** Drop Ruby 2.5, Rails 5.2 [#438](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/438)
* Migrate continuous integration from CircleCI to GitHub Actions with expanded Ruby × Rails CI matrix.
* Support AWS temporary credentials (`aws_session_token` / `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) for S3 uploads in AWS Lambda [#415](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/415)
* Add `frozen_string_literal: true` magic comments [#430](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/430)
* Add support for Rails 8.0 [#441](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/441)
* Fix uninitialized constant ActiveSupport::LoggerThreadSafeLevel::Logger [#449](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/449)
* Add support for Ruby 3.4 [#451](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/451)
* Add support for Rails 8.1 [#461](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/461)
* Replace CGI-based escaping with `URI.encode_www_form_component` for ping URLs; remove reliance on `cgi` (Ruby 4 compatibility) [#465](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/465)
* Add support for Ruby 4.0 [#466](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/466)
* Add ActiveStorage adapter (`ActiveStorage::Blob`) [#467](https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator/pull/467)

## 6.0.1
